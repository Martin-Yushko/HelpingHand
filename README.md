# HelpingHand

Helping Hand was project inspired by a need I identified for tutoring to become a modern industry! No one (almost no one) checks message boards nowadays - at least, that was my experience when I was a peer tutor at my high school -, and modernizing it into an app seemed like the best way to fill that gap.

This app was developed from the vision I had of what such an app would look like, and there are several features already developer:

* Google API intergration to be presented with a beautiful view of tutors around your area.
* Editing your profile to customize the tutors that appear on the map, and to tell other people a little about you.
* Ability to request tutors and be informed of good tutors on the platform via ratings and reviews.
* Added notifications for important events in the app such as when a tutor accepts your request.
* Created a pseudo-backend. It isn't integrated since the app isn't actually launched and this is more of a proof of concept.



### How To Use

6. You will see that the tutor has accepted your request! You may now begin messaging them to talk about where to meet, what to bring, etc. (this is a dummy messaging screen; not implemented yet)

7. If you change your mind, you can cancel, and start the process over!

You can also go to your profile to edit your information, and the map has a search function. Search "Calculus" and then zoom out for an example of how this works. Enjoy!
